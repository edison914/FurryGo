There is something in this family-oriented park for everyone, including an off-leash area for the doggos!  The off-leash area can be tricky to find, because it's not fenced in. After crossing a little footbridge, you'll find other puppers playing near the shallow, clear, stream. Although the park is not fenced in, it's bordered by the stream and a steep hill which keeps dogs in the valley. It's not near the streets, but be sure your pal doesn't chase a squirrel into the woods and get lost! There are nature paths, woods, and hills, that your pooch can scamper through like a wild dog before cooling off in the stream. Pet-parents love bringing their dogs here, so Fido shouldn't have any problems finding playmates!",
