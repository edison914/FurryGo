# `FurryGo`
FurryGo is an online community hub where pet lovers can discover and review animal-friendly businesses. The app was developed using Flask in Python for the backend and React.js for the frontend. Vue.js serves as the primary front-end tooling and build system. The demo provides users with features such as sign-up, sign-in, full CRUD operations on pet-friendly places, reviews with pictures, rating places, and bookmarking them. Additionally, images of the places and reviews are uploaded, updated, and maintained on AWS S3.
